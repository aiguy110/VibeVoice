Speaker 1: Generating long-form, multi-speaker conversational audio like podcasts poses significant challenges for traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking. This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing the next-token diffusion framework, a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively generating latent vectors via diffusion.
